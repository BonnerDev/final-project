#things I want to do with this data
#I want to show the differences in Non Indigenous and Indigenous children in out of home care throughout WA, from 2008 to 2017. I will visualise this using a double bar graph with one colour for Indigenous and one for Non Indigenous. Then show some predictive analysis on where we might see these numbers going based on histroical data. 
#data from 2012 to 2013 showing the relationship to their carer based on Inigenous or not using double bar chart and group by type of carer
#data from 2012 to 2013 showing length of out of home care in relation to how many placements they have been in, show what percentage of them in each bracket of length of out of home care, show what is the average number of placements for each length of out of home care 
#Children receiving child protection services, by age group, Indigenous status and state or territory, 2018â€“19
